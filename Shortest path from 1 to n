PROBLEM: Consider a directed graph whose vertices are numbered from 1 to n. There is an edge from a vertex i to a vertex j.
         if either j = i + 1 or j = 3 * i. The task is to find the minimum number of edges in a path in G from vertex 1 to vertex n.


Example: N = 9
Output: 2

Explanation: 9 -> 3 -> 1, so number of steps are 2.

SOLUTION:

    int minimumStep(int n)
    {
        int cnt=0;
        while(n>1){
            if(n%3==0){
                n=n/3;
            }
            else{
                n=n-1;
            }
            cnt++;
        }
        return cnt;
    }
